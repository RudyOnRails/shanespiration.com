      <h2>Shane’s Story</h2>
      
      <div class="row" id="story">
      
        <div class="col-sm-12">
        
        <p>In 2001 at the age of 21, while a student and basketball player at Assumption College, Shane was diagnosed with Stage 1A melanoma cancer. A wider excision was done at the Univ. of Chicago. Shane was checked and remained cancer free for about 8 years. Then the beast returned. Since Jan. 2009, Shane has undergone several surgeries, including a brain surgery at MDA in Houston TX. He has been on countless therapies in his search for a cure. Many have helped over the years. Shane is a fighter, and continued his battle at the NIH.  Shane participated in a clinical trial May 7th, 2015. He was the 7th person to receive this treatment. However, he did not have a full response to the treatment. Over the summer, he was admitted to the hospital and had spent 11 weeks  there with various complications. The main issue has been the growth of the tumor in his abdomen, which is now the size of a watermelon. Shane is restarting a previous treatment, a BRAF targeted therapy similar to the one he had a positive response to before. We are hoping that this treatment will give Shane the opportunity to recover a bit from the last few months in the hospital and get him to a place where he can continue his tenacious fight against melanoma.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Shane’s story is a prime example of why funding for cancer research is crucial!</strong></p>

      <h3>Here are some helpful hints when ordering the shirts: </h3>
      <ol>
      <li>Kids sizes are now available ($10)</li>
      <li>there is a $6 processing fee online PER ORDER not per tee shirt, so try to order with family or friends (we had no control over this) </li>
      <li>for the PLAYER NAME box info online - please put the name of the person or company you affiliated with - ie. If you are a friend of someone in the family put their name. So if you know Colleen Marie put her name. If you know one of the Barrys, put Barry. If you are connected because you know Dayna, put her name. You get the idea! </li>
      </ol>
      &#9733;&#9733;&#9733; Knowing your connection to Shane or his extended family and friends will help us greatly when the tee shirts are ready as the shirts will be delivered to us sorted by Player Name. 
      
      <p>We are all set for everyone that has already placed an order!!</p>
      
      <p>Thanks to everyone who has helped share and spread the word about the tee shirts! It is so awesome seeing shirts being ordered all over the country and across the pond to support this fantastic cause. You never know where you will run into someone wearing one of these awesome tee shirts !  If you have any questions feel free to message any one of us.</p>

      <h2>Behind the Attitude</h2>
      
      <p>If you're curious where the design for the shirt comes from it is inspired by Shane and some of the wonderful people who he has met through various phases of his melanoma journey. </p>
      <p>The first picture is a post from Shane's instagram and we have taken the term attitude and run it through the melanoma awareness ribbon. </p>
      <p>Next to that you find “You never know what you’re training for” which is a quote that Vicki, one of Shane’s favorite yoga instructors, used to say in class. Shane has said that yoga has helped him through scans and treatments where he had to remain still for extended periods of time and focus on his breathing.</p>
